Fix save system: RapSheet and ParoleRecord now save/load correctly

This commit fixes critical issues preventing RapSheet and ParoleRecord data
from persisting across game sessions. The save system was creating files but
they were either empty or not being loaded correctly.

Additionally, this commit migrates the save system from using UserDataDirectory
to the game's save folder structure, ensuring mod data is properly integrated
with game saves and persists correctly across save/load cycles.

Changes:

0. Migrated save system to game save folders:
   - Changed from saving to MelonEnvironment.UserDataDirectory to game's save
     folder structure (Modded/Saveables/)
   - SaveablePatches now saves to {saveFolderPath}/Modded/Saveables/ for
     integration with game's save system
   - Loads from LoadManager.LoadedGameFolderPath/Modded/Saveables/ to ensure
     data loads with the correct save file
   - Added whitelisting of Modded paths in SaveManager to prevent cleanup
     deletion of mod save files
   - This ensures mod data is tied to specific save files and travels with
     save backups/transfers

1. Fixed RapSheet saving:
   - Added GetAllRapSheets() method to RapSheetManager to expose cached instances
   - Updated SaveablePatches.SaveManager_Save_Postfix() to save per-player
     saveables (RapSheets) that are excluded from auto-discovery
   - Added logic to only save RapSheets that have changed (HasChanged flag)
   - Added comprehensive debug logging for save process tracking

2. Fixed RapSheet loading:
   - Modified RapSheet constructor to accept skipOnLoaded parameter
   - Updated RapSheetManager.GetRapSheet() to check for save data before
     creating RapSheet instance
   - Fixed initialization order: LoadInternal() now called before OnLoaded()
     to prevent loaded data from being overwritten by initialization
   - Added error handling to call OnLoaded() via ISaveable interface if
     loading fails
   - Added debug logging to track loading state and verify data persistence

3. Fixed ParoleRecord serialization:
   - Added HasSaveableFields() helper method to detect types with SaveableField
     attributes
   - Updated SaveInternal() to detect nested objects with SaveableField
     attributes (like ParoleRecord) and use SaveableSerializer.SerializeValue()
     instead of standard JsonConvert.SerializeObject()
   - Updated LoadInternal() to detect nested objects and use
     SaveableSerializer.DeserializeValue() for proper deserialization
   - Made SaveableSerializer.SerializeValue() and DeserializeValue() public
     to support nested object serialization
   - Added debug logging to track serialization method used

Files modified:
- Harmony/SaveablePatches.cs: Migrated to game save folders, added RapSheet saving logic, improved logging
- Systems/CrimeTracking/RapSheet.cs: Added skipOnLoaded parameter to constructor
- Systems/CrimeTracking/RapSheetManager.cs: Added GetAllRapSheets(), fixed loading logic
- Utils/Saveable/Saveable.cs: Added HasSaveableFields(), fixed SaveInternal/LoadInternal
- Utils/Saveable/SaveableSerializer.cs: Made SerializeValue/DeserializeValue public

This ensures that:
- Mod data is saved within game save folders (Modded/Saveables/) instead of
  UserDataDirectory, ensuring proper integration with game's save system
- RapSheets are properly saved to Modded/Saveables/BehindBars/{PlayerName}/
- ParoleRecord data (including parole status, violations, pause state) persists
- Data loads correctly on game restart without being overwritten
- Save data travels with game saves for easy backup/transfer
- Debug logs help identify any future save/load issues
