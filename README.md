# Behind Bars - Schedule I Mod

## Overview

Behind Bars is a comprehensive mod for Schedule I that significantly expands the after-arrest experience. Instead of the basic arrest mechanics, players now face a complete criminal justice system including jail time, bail negotiations, court proceedings, and probation periods.

## Features

### üöî Jail System
- **Severity Assessment**: Crimes are automatically assessed for severity (Minor, Moderate, Major, Severe)
- **Dynamic Sentencing**: Jail time and fines scale based on crime severity and player level
- **Flexible Options**: Players can choose between paying fines or serving jail time
- **Realistic Scaling**: Higher-level players face stiffer penalties, barons can't escape with petty fines

### üí∞ Bail System
- **Smart Calculation**: Bail amounts are 2.5x the fine amount, adjusted for player status
- **Negotiation Support**: Bail amounts can be negotiated based on player skills and evidence
- **Multiplayer Integration**: Friends can pay bail for arrested players in multiplayer sessions
- **Level-Appropriate Pricing**: Bail scales with player level and wealth status

### ‚öñÔ∏è Court System
- **Courtroom Experience**: Full court session with judge, charges, and sentencing
- **Bail Negotiation**: Players can negotiate bail amounts using skills, evidence, and witnesses
- **Time-Limited Sessions**: 60-second negotiation windows add urgency and strategy
- **Deal-Based Mechanics**: Similar to pawn shop negotiations but in a legal context

### üëÆ Probation System
- **Probation Officer NPC**: New NPC that patrols and conducts random searches
- **Random Body Searches**: Unpredictable search intervals (30-120 seconds)
- **Violation Tracking**: Multiple violations can extend probation or lead to revocation
- **Progressive Consequences**: Violations increase probation duration and severity

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each system (Jail, Bail, Court, Probation) is self-contained
- **Event-Driven**: Systems communicate through events and callbacks
- **Conditional Compilation**: Supports both Mono and IL2CPP versions using `#if !MONO` directives
- **Harmony Integration**: Uses Harmony for patching game systems

### Core Systems
1. **JailSystem**: Handles arrest processing, severity assessment, and jail mechanics
2. **BailSystem**: Manages bail calculations, payments, and multiplayer support
3. **CourtSystem**: Controls court sessions, negotiations, and sentencing
4. **ProbationSystem**: Manages probation periods, NPC spawning, and violation tracking

### Player Management
- **PlayerHandler**: Tracks individual player criminal records and status
- **CriminalRecord**: Comprehensive tracking of arrests, jail time, fines, and violations
- **Multiplayer Support**: Handles player interactions across network sessions
