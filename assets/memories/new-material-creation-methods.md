# New Material Creation Methods Added to AssetManager

## Task Completed
Added two new material creation methods to the `Systems/AssetManager.cs` file to extend the existing material creation functionality.

## New Methods Added

### 1. CreateMetalMaterial(Color color, float metallic)
- **Purpose**: Creates a metal material with customizable color and metallic properties
- **Parameters**: 
  - `color`: The base color for the material
  - `metallic`: The metallic value (0.0 to 1.0, automatically clamped)
- **Features**:
  - Uses Universal Render Pipeline shader
  - Higher smoothness (0.8) for realistic metal appearance
  - Metallic value is clamped to valid range (0.0-1.0)
  - Includes proper error handling and logging

### 2. CreateClothMaterial(Color color)
- **Purpose**: Creates a cloth material with the specified color
- **Parameters**: 
  - `color`: The base color for the material
- **Features**:
  - Currently identical to the existing `CreateMaterial(Color color)` method
  - Designed to be easily customizable later for cloth-specific properties
  - Uses Universal Render Pipeline shader
  - Zero metallic value for non-metallic appearance

## Implementation Details
- Both methods follow the same pattern as existing `CreateMaterial` methods
- Use conditional compilation for Mono and Il2Cpp versions (`#if !MONO`)
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging via `ModLogger`
- Set appropriate default values for material properties
- Maintain consistency with existing material creation patterns

## Location
Added to `Systems/AssetManager.cs` right before the closing brace of the `AssetManager` class, maintaining the existing code structure.

## Future Customization
The `CreateClothMaterial` method is designed to be easily modified later to include cloth-specific properties such as:
- Fabric texture properties
- Subsurface scattering for realistic cloth appearance
- Normal map support for fabric detail
- Custom shader properties for cloth materials

## Date Added
December 2024
